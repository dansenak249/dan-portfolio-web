<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;color:#7D6799'>Looking for a
sweet teammate for your project?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>I’m always open to collaborating with animators, designers, game
devs, writers, indie creators, or anyone who’s dreaming up a creative project,
especially if you’re into soft, cute, and feminine artstyles like mine</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>Whether you're part of a professional team or just starting out
solo, if you have passion and a kind heart, I’d be so happy to join you. I’m
always looking for reliable partners to create meaningful work together and
build something that helps both sides grow with long term goals in mind</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>If you’ve got an idea but don’t know where to start, I can help
with a variety of visual tasks like character design, key visuals, cover art,
concept art, or moodboards to shape your project's vibe. I’ve also worked on
short comics like 4koma, emotes, stickers, merch, and can assist with visual
consistency to keep your project cute, cohesive, and inspiring</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>To me ideal collaboration means mutual respect, clear
communication, and trusting the value each person brings. I don’t expect
constant checkins, just showing up when it matters and doing your part with
care. I especially appreciate projects with fair profit sharing or longterm
vision. I’m also open to non profit projects if they help expand my creative
reach or bring emotional value</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;color:#7D6799'>Curious what
I’ve worked on outside of commissions?</span><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif'>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>I’ve created 4koma comics for Amelodious, a Hatsune Miku fan
event in Vietnam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>I took a commission for a coloring book that was published and
sold on Amazon, made for both kids and adults who love to relax, under the name
April Amber. It received such lovely feedback.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>I’ve also illustrated for the Nijien Vtuber Project, made fan
merch, and ran a booth at Color Fiesta Festival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>One of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had was working with
animator Lya Korone on animation projects, and being part of Moshie Studio for
a long time. It’s a wonderful place that gave me space to grow as an artist.
While I can’t post those projects on my own channels, you can find some of the
older works credited to me on their official pages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;color:#7D6799'>Why join a
project instead of just doing commissions?</span><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif'>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>With commissions, I bring someone else’s idea to life. But in a
project, I get to be part of the creative journey, grow with the work, and help
create something greater than myself. I want to bring value to the community
and make something that lasts. Right now, what I can offer most is my passion
and openness to join projects that feel right to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>I’ve always dreamed of collaborating with motion animators and
editors. While I don’t have experience in motion animation yet, I’m more than
willing to learn and adjust to support the team. One of my proudest projects
was working with the talented Lya Korone to create animated stream alerts,
which became my main source of income for a long time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>I’d also love to be part of a 2DMV project someday. If there’s a
chance to take part in something like that, I’m in. I’m also open to becoming
the lead artist for print products, as long as there’s clear and respectful
communication</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>In a team, I hope to be the one who brings color and emotion
into the project, from designing characters and key illustrations to small
touches like stickers, emotes, and layout. I pay close attention to the
emotional flow of a project, from the color palette to the cute vibe and the
personality of each character. If you need someone to keep the visual world of
your project consistent, expressive, and full of charm, I’d love to help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;color:#7D6799'>Want to invite
me to your project?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>If you think we’d be a good match, feel free to contact me
through</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"UTM Aptima",serif;
color:#7D6799'>And if you’re unsure because your project doesn’t feel
“professional enough” I just want to say this: every dream starts somewhere. If
you have a bold idea and need someone to walk alongside you, I believe that
dream deserves to be nurtured. I’ll always give my best with my skills and
heart to help you make it happen.</span></p>
